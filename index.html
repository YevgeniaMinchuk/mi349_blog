                <h3> My Mister (2018) </h3>
                <time datetime="2024-10-13">October 13, 2024</time>

                <p> Kim Won-seok's My Mister was a thought-provoking, deeply emotional, and suspenseful drama that weaves together themes of hardship and unlikely human connections. The story focuses on Dong-Hoon, a middle-aged engineer trying to withstand familial, marriage, and career struggles. Unbeknown to him, his wife of over a decade has been having a year-long affair with his boss. At the same time, Ji-an, a young woman in her 20s is trying to singlehandedly pay off her family's debt while trying to take care of her disabled grandmother by any means possible, even when they're illegal. Initially, Ji-an works as a temporary office assistant in Dong-Hoon's workplace and is then hired by his boss to set him up in a scandal that would cost him his job. As the show progresses, Ji-an and Dong-Hoon form an unexpected bond and strive to help each other overcome their hardships.

                The show's poster captures the dynamic between the characters perfectly, as Ji-an observes Dong-Hoon from afar, while he remains unaware of her gaze. One thing I found compelling is that the show never reveals the internal thoughts of the characters, forcing the audience to decipher their feelings through dialogue and nuanced performances alone. The actors give their heartfelt performances and the plot keeps viewers engaged through building tension and moments of tenderness. This is a show filled with hope and humanity in the face of despair. I found myself rooting for the characters and missing them once the series came to an end. </p>

                <h3> Unfrosted (2024) </h3>
                <time datetime="2024-10-12">October 12, 2024</time>
                <address class="author"><strong>Author:</strong> Yevgenia Minchuk</address>
                <p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE1NzA1MWMtZTIyZi00ZDYxLWJlMTYtZjNjMmM4ZWMxNGRkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" alt="Unfrosted (2024) Movie Poster" style="width: 350px; height: auto"></p>
                <p> Jerry Seinfeld's Unfrosted tells the fictionalized story of how Kellogg's and Post competed to make a pastry that would "change the face of breakfast forever". This movie was entertaining in an almost absurd way, I often thought, "Why am I watching this cereal movie?" Despite its humor, parts of the film felt predictable and flat. The characters came across as two-dimensional and I couldn't bring myself to genuinely care about them. The story was entertaining to watch with a group of friends to commentate on, but beyond that, the film didn't strike a chord with me and is unmemorable. This film does not take itself seriously, which could have been a strength, but it ultimately made it hard for me to take it seriously either. <br>
                At times, Unfrosted felt like a prolonged cereal commercial with ironic messaging about the health risks of cereal. The film criticizes how these products are loaded with artificial ingredients and offer little nutritional value, yet still promote it as a breakfast food. It was as if Kellogg's and Post were saying, "We know it's bad for you, but we'll keep selling it at $5 a box because you'll keep buying it." It was clear to me that the tone was supposed to come off as self-aware and satirical, but when the jokes are made by multi-billion-dollar corporations they lose their humor. </p>
